# Burgers-Express
- Javascript burger consuming application requiring the express web application framework, Handlebars.js, and hosted on Heroku. 

**ABOUT THIS APP** 
- Burgers Express is a javascript applications that recreates the process in which databases are referenced and hosted on a live Heroku application, and referenced via a custom ORM. A user can see the existing burgers with options to consume them, and add their own burger. 

- Express, and Handlebars.js are the  NPMs required for running the application. Express is required for hosting the page on the Heroku website; and Handlebars.js is required for constructing the HTML view sent to the HTML routes.

**Purpose of this app**
- This app was fundamental in solidifying the programmer's (myself, Logan McNulty) knowledge of working with, most importantly, the custom ORMs and the Handlebars.js NPM. It instilled the purpose of, and methods required to, communicate with a databse using an ORM, and displaying the contents of the database on an HTML page using Handlebars.js. This app also further familiarized the programmer with the process of hosting a Jaws database on Heroku in place of a local MySql database. Previously the programmer was familiar with making get requests to third party APIs using AJAX calls. Having outlined the steps required to set up a server, define the paths required for routing, posting data to the friends API, and retrieving it in real time, brought the API and webframework process "full circle".
